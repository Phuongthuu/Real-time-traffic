Waze displays this data in their app (http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_...), and the app itself is open source (http://www.waze.com/wiki/index.p...). If you really wanted to dig in, you may be able to replicate whatever RPC they're making to get the traffic data from their servers and use it in your own application.
